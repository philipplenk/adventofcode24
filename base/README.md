This directory contains the *default* files, which I used as a starting point when starting work on any given day. Calling tools/init.sh copies these files into the active directory.

The 01/02.cpp files simply contain necessary boilerplate(frequently used include declarations and an empty main function), whilst the Makefile contains targets to build both parts, run them with the previously downloaded input as stdin and submit the stdout to the aoc website.
